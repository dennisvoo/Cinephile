# Cinephile
This is a forum-like movie app where users can suggest movies from TMDb api. Each suggestion is its own post that can be
commented on by other users.

## About This App
This app was created on the MERN stack, using MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, and NodeJS. The movies are pulled from the TMDb
movie database using axios. Each suggestion and user is stored on the back-end using MongoDB. The front-end was created with
React, with the help of create-react-app.

## Features
Users can log in or sign up for an account. Any user can suggest movies or make comments but only the creator of a post or
comment can delete it. On the home page, one can sign in and then use the search feature to suggest a movie. Anybody, guest
or user, can click on one of the cards on the home page to view a movie suggestion and its comments.
